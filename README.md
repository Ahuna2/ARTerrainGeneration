# ARTerrainGeneration

Created as a part of my bachelor thesis. Full text (in Estonian) available at university [website](https://comserv.cs.ut.ee/ati_thesis/datasheet.php?id=71658&year=2021).

This app allows userâ€™s environment to be scanned and used for the generation of a landscape that is affected by any objects in the scanned area.
The project uses an iPad's LiDAR sensor to map user's surroundings, processes the gathered info, applies noise and erosion algorithms to it and projects the shaded final landscape.

Some examples of the app in use before and after generating a landscape:

There are literally hundreds of possible ways to enhance and develop this project, but this was enough for my thesis. Might come back to it though.
